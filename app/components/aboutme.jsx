        Hi there, I'm Daniel Mercedes, and I was born and raised in the beautiful Dominican Republic. Currently, I'm living in the vibrant city of Berlin, Germany. I have always been fascinated by languages and love learning new ones. Whether it's Spanish, English, or any other language, I find it incredibly fulfilling to be able to communicate with people from different backgrounds and cultures.

        Apart from my love of languages, I am also very passionate about exploring new subjects and ideas. I am a lifelong learner and am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and expand my knowledge.

        Overall, I am a curious and adventurous person who is always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn. I'm excited to see what the future holds and can't wait to see where my passions will take me next.
